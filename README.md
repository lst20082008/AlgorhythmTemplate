# AlgorithmmTemplate
Templates for algorithm. c++ version.
# Why I create this project
I find there are many problems can be solved with those classical algorithms. The only thing I need to do is to find the suitable algorithm and do a little change. So I decide to sort out those algorithms.
# How I organized each algorithm
I will write down the template and find some problems in Leetcode and show how to solve the problem with the template.
